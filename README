Open New in Tabs

My first Chromium extension, intended mostly as a learning experience.

Set up as a page action, this extension activates itself for a specific forum I
visit every day. On that page, clicking on the page action scrapes the page for
all the links that go to the newest post in that thread, then opens them in
tabs, staggered using a timer to not crunch Chromium too badly.

TODO:
Parameterize everything!
- Sites to activate on, regexp to use to scrape the links.
- Time between opening the tabs.
- Order to open the links in (hardwired to last to first right now).
- Fix the icons! Bad icons! Bad!
